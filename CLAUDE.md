# CLAUDE.md

Persistent memory for this project. Read this before making changes; update it
whenever a core feature, scene, weapon, or key binding is added or changed
(see **AI Workflow Rules** below).

## 1. Project Overview

Godot 4.7 (mono/C#-enabled, GDScript used throughout) sandbox combining:
- A Source-engine (Counter-Strike) style first-person movement controller —
  ground/air acceleration, bunny-hopping, air-strafing, crouch.
- A two-weapon combat testbed — a hitscan pistol and a melee sword — on a
  CSG test level of jump blocks, ramps and stairs for movement testing.

Config: `project.godot`. Main scene: `res://scenes/Main.tscn`. Autoload:
`GameSettings` (`scenes/GameSettings.gd`) — persisted sensitivity/volume.

## 2. Current Scene & Node Architecture

### `scenes/Main.tscn`
- `WorldEnvironment` — procedural sky, tonemap.
- `DirectionalLight3D` — shadows enabled.
- `Floor` (CSGBox3D, 50×1×50) + `JumpBlock1`–`9` (CSGBox3D, varying heights)
  + `Ramp` + `Stair0`–`5` (stepped CSGBox3D) — hand-placed movement-test geometry.
- `Player` — instance of `Player.tscn`.

### `scenes/Player.tscn` (`CharacterBody3D`, script `Player.gd`)

```

**Movement/bhop tunables** (`Player.gd`, all `@export`):
`mouse_sensitivity`, `pitch_limit_deg`, `max_speed` (7.0), `walk_speed` (3.5),
`ground_accel`, `friction`, `stop_speed`, `air_accel`, `air_cap` (0.8 — the
air-strafe target-speed clamp), `jump_velocity`, `gravity`, `auto_bhop`,
`crouch_speed`, `crouch_height`, `crouch_eye`, `crouch_transition_speed`,
`units_per_metre` (debug HUD only).

Weapon slot switching lives in `Player.gd`: `weapons: Array[Node3D]` =
`[Pistol, Sword]`, `equip(slot)` sets exactly one weapon's `equipped = true`
(which drives that weapon's own `visible` and input-processing gate).

### Weapon System

**Slot 1 — Pistol** (`scenes/Pistol.tscn`, script `Pistol.gd`)
- Hitscan: fires via the shared `Head/Camera3D/RayCast3D`, resolved with
  `force_raycast_update()` at the moment of firing (not last physics tick).
- Fires on the `fire` action, gated by `fire_cooldown` (0.15s) and `equipped`.
- Spawns a fading unshaded white beam (`_spawn_tracer`) from the muzzle to the
  hit point (or ray's max range if nothing hit); parented to the current scene
  (not the weapon) so it stays put in the world. Tunables: `tracer_lifetime`
  (0.25s), `tracer_thickness`, `tracer_color`, `tracer_draw_on_top`.
- Ammo: `magazine_size` (15), `magazine_count` (7), `infinite_ammo` (true by
  default — counters display but never drop). Reload (`reload` action) plays a
  tween dip/tilt over `reload_time` (1.0s) and blocks firing meanwhile.
- `ammo_label` (exported `Label` ref → HUD/AmmoLabel) shows `"N / mag \n MAGS m"`.
- **Important:** the `Pistol` node in `Player.tscn` must declare
  `node_paths=PackedStringArray("ray", "ammo_label")` in its `[node]` header or
  these exported NodePaths silently resolve to `null` (see §5 below).

**Slot 2 — Sword** (`scenes/sword.tscn`, script `Sword.gd`, wraps a `.blend`
katana model in `3DModels/`)
- Melee: reuses the **camera's** RayCast3D (not a locally-aimed one — the
  Sword node is rotated ~84° on Y in the scene, so its own -Z does not point
  forward), clipped to `melee_range` (2.75m) via an explicit distance check
  since the shared ray reaches 100m for the pistol.
- Attacks on `fire`, gated by `attack_cooldown` (0.5s) and `equipped`.
- On a connecting hit, calls `take_damage(damage)` (40.0) on the collider if it
  has that method, and emits `hit_target(collider, point)`.
- No baked animation — slash is procedural: a `Tween` swings `rotation`/
  `position` out to a peak offset over `slash_time` (0.1s, quad ease-out), then
  eases back to the authored idle pose over `return_time` (0.2s, sine in-out).
  Peak offsets (`slash_rotation_deg`, `slash_offset`) are tuned for visible
  travel across the screen — small offsets read as an in-place twist, not a
  slash. In-flight tweens are killed before a new swing starts so spamming
  attacks can't strand the blade off-pose.
- Also needs `node_paths=PackedStringArray("ray")` on its `[node]` entry in
  `Player.tscn`.

## 3. Controls & Key Bindings

| Action | Input | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `move_forward` / `move_back` | W / S | |
| `move_left` / `move_right` | A / D | |
| `jump` | Space | Held for auto-bhop when `auto_bhop = true` |
| `crouch` | C / Ctrl | |
| `walk` | Shift | Slows to `walk_speed`; overridden by crouch if both held |
| `slot_1` | 1 | Equip Pistol |
| `slot_2` | 2 | Equip Sword |
| `slot_next` | Mouse wheel down | Cycle weapon forward |
| `slot_prev` | Mouse wheel up | Cycle weapon backward |
| `fire` | Left Click | Pistol: shoot. Sword: melee swing |
| `reload` | R | Pistol only |
| `ui_cancel` | Esc | Opens/closes SettingsMenu; pauses the tree while open |

## 4. AI Workflow Rules

**Whenever a new core feature, scene, weapon, or key binding is added or
modified, automatically update this `CLAUDE.md` file with concise notes before
considering the task complete.** Keep entries factual and current — prefer
editing the relevant section above over appending a changelog.

## 5. Known Gotchas (learned the hard way — see project memory for more)

- **Hand-edited `.tscn` node references silently break.** Any `[node]` that
  assigns an `@export var x: SomeNodeType` (not a plain `NodePath`) must list
  that property name in `node_paths=PackedStringArray(...)` on the same
  `[node]` line, or Godot stores a raw `NodePath` that never resolves — the
  property stays `null` with no error or warning. Always grep a hand-edited
  `.tscn` for `= NodePath(` and confirm the owning `[node]` header has the
  marker.
- **Editing `project.godot` (autoloads, input actions) while the editor has
  the project open does not take effect until you Project → Reload Current
  Project.** A running editor session keeps its own in-memory copy; a fresh
  engine/CLI run reads the file fine, which can make a bug look fixed in
  headless verification while the open editor still errors.
- **`Input.mouse_mode` is stubbed under `--headless`** (always reads back
  `VISIBLE`) — anything gated on `MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED` (crosshair visibility,
  look input) needs a windowed run (`--resolution WxH`, no `--headless`) to
  verify for real.
